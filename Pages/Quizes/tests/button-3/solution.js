    question: "The primary function of respiration in plants is to:",
    a: "Produce energy",
    b: "Release oxygen",
    c: "Produce glucose",
    d: "Release carbon dioxide",
    correct: "a",
    explanation: "The primary function of respiration in plants is to produce energy. Through respiration, plants convert stored energy in glucose into a usable form, ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is essential for various cellular processes.",
    topic: "Energy Production",
    difficulty: "Easy",
  },
  {
    question: "Which organelle is responsible for respiration in plant cells ?",
    a: "Mitochondria",
    b: "Chloroplasts",
    c: "Nucleus",
    d: "Endoplasmic reticulum",
    correct: "a",
    explanation: "Respiration in plant cells primarily occurs in the mitochondria. Mitochondria are known as the 'powerhouses' of the cell because they generate ATP through the process of cellular respiration.",
    topic: "Mitochondria",
    difficulty: "Hard",
  },
  {
    question: "The process of respiration in plants occurs in :",
    a: "Day only",
    b: "Night only",
    c: "Both day and night",
    d: "None of the above",
    correct: "c",
    explanation: "Respiration in plants occurs both during the day and night. While photosynthesis occurs primarily during the day when sunlight is available, respiration is a continuous process necessary for energy production and occurs throughout the day and night.",
    topic: "Duration of respiration",
    difficulty: "Hard",
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is not a stage of respiration in plants ?",
    a: "Glycolysis",
    b: "Krebs cycle",
    c: "Electron transport chain",
    d: "Transpiration",
    correct: "d",
    explanation: "Transpiration is the process of water movement through a plant and is not a stage of respiration. Glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain are stages of cellular respiration where glucose is broken down to produce ATP.",
    topic: "Transpiration",
    difficulty: "Medium",
  },
  {
    question: "In which part of the plant does respiration primarily occur ?",
    a: "Leaves",
    b: "Stem",
    c: "Roots",
    d: "Flowers",
    correct: "a",
    explanation: "Respiration primarily occurs in the leaves of the plant. Leaves contain a large number of stomata and chloroplasts, facilitating gas exchange and cellular respiration.",
    topic: "Respiration Parts",
    difficulty: "Easy",
  },
  {
    question: "The final product of respiration in plants is :",
    a: "Water",
    b: "Glucose",
    c: "Oxygen",
    d: "Carbon dioxide",
    correct: "d",
    explanation: "The final product of respiration in plants is carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚). During cellular respiration, glucose is broken down in the presence of oxygen to produce ATP, carbon dioxide, and water.",
    topic: "Product of Respiration",
    difficulty: "Easy",
  },
  {
    question: "The breakdown of glucose in respiration results in the production of:",
    a: "Energy and carbon dioxide",
    b: "Energy and oxygen",
    c: "Water and carbon dioxide",
    d: "Water and oxygen",
    correct: "a",
    explanation: "The breakdown of glucose in respiration results in the production of energy (in the form of ATP) and carbon dioxide. This process occurs through glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain.",
    topic: "Breakdown",
    difficulty: "Medium",
  },
  {
    question: "The process of photosynthesis in plants is the opposite of:",
    a: "Respiration",
    b: "Transpiration",
    c: "Fertilization",
    d: "Pollination",
    correct: "a",
    explanation: "The process of photosynthesis in plants is the opposite of respiration. While photosynthesis converts carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen using light energy, respiration breaks down glucose into carbon dioxide and water to release energy.",
    topic: "Photosynthesis",
    difficulty: "Medium",
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is not a type of respiration in plants ?",
    a: "Aerobic respiration",
    b: "Anaerobic respiration",
    c: "Photosynthetic respiration",
    d: "Fermentation",
    correct: "d",
    explanation: "Fermentation is not a type of respiration in plants. Aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration are the two main types of respiration, while photosynthetic respiration refers to the integration of photosynthesis and respiration processes in plants.",
    topic: "Type of Respiration",
    difficulty: "Easy",
  },
  {
    question: "The energy produced by respiration in plants is used for:",
    a: "Growth and development",
    b: "Reproduction",
    c: "Defense against predators",
    d: "All of the above",
    correct: "d",
    explanation: "The energy produced by respiration in plants is used for various purposes, including growth and development, reproduction, and defense against predators. Energy in the form of ATP is essential for carrying out all cellular processes in plants.",
