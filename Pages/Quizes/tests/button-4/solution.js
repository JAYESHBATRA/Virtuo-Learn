    question: "What causes the motion of a body which is initially in the state of rest?",
    a: "Force",
    b: "Displacement",
    c: "Speed",
    d: "Velocity",
    correct: "a",
    explanation: "According to Newton's first law of motion, an object at rest will remain at rest unless acted upon by an external force. Therefore, the motion of a body initially at rest is caused by the application of a force.",
    topic: "First Law of Motion",
    difficulty: "Easy",
  },
  {
    question: "Passengers sitting in a stationary car experience a jerk when the car suddenly starts. This is due to _____",
    a: "Inertia of Motion",
    b: "Inertia of rest",
    c: "Inertia of turning",
    d: "Inertia of acceleration",
    correct: "b",
    explanation: "When the stationary car suddenly starts, passengers experience a jerk due to their inertia of rest. Inertia of rest is the tendency of stationary objects to resist changes in their state of rest.",

    difficulty: "Medium",
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following have always the same direction?",
    a: "Force and acceleration",
    b: "Force and momentum",
    c: "Force and velocity",
    d: "None of these",
    correct: "a",
    explanation: "Force and acceleration always have the same direction according to Newton's second law of motion. The direction of force determines the direction of acceleration experienced by an object.",
    topic: "Force and Directions",
    difficulty: "Easy",
  },
  {
    question: "Two bodies moving with constant velocities collide with each other. Which of the following quantities remain conserved?",
    a: "Momentum",
    b: "Speed",
    c: "Force",
    d: "Velocity",
    correct: "a",
    explanation: "In a collision between two bodies with constant velocities, momentum remains conserved. According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of a closed system remains constant if no external forces act on it.",
    topic: "Conservation of Momentum",
    difficulty: "Medium",
  },
  {
    question: "A truck with a mass of 2500 Kg traveling with an acceleration of 5 m/s2 hits a scooter. What force does the truck experience?",
    a: "12500 N",
    b: "500 N",
    c: "10000 N",
    d: "2500 N",
    correct: "a",
    explanation: "According to Newton's third law of motion, the force exerted by the truck on the scooter is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted by the scooter on the truck. Therefore, the force experienced by the truck is calculated as mass multiplied by acceleration, i.e., 2500 kg * 5 m/sÂ² = 12500 N.",

  {
    question: "Unit of force is _____",
    a: "Pascal",
    b: "Newton",
    c: "Byte",
    d: "Gram",
    correct: "b",
    explanation: "The unit of force is the Newton (N). It is defined as the force required to accelerate a one-kilogram mass by one meter per second squared.",
    topic: "Force",
    difficulty: "Easy",
  },
  {
    question: "Two forces are acting on a body. For the body to remain in equilibrium, the forces have to be ____",
    a: "Equal in magnitude and opposite in direction",
    b: "Equal in direction and opposite in magnitude",
    c: "In the same direction",
    d: "In perpendicular directions",
    correct: "a",
    explanation: "For a body to remain in equilibrium, the forces acting on it must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. This ensures that the net force acting on the body is zero.",
    topic: "Equilibrium",
    difficulty: "Medium",
  },
  {
    question: "What does Newton's second law of motion state?",
    a: "An object at rest will remain at rest unless acted upon by an external force.",
    b: "The net force acting on an object is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration.",
    c: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.",
    d: "The velocity of an object remains constant if the net force acting on it is zero.",
    correct: "b",
    explanation: "Newton's second law of motion states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration. Mathematically, it is expressed as F = ma, where F is the net force, m is the mass of the object, and a is its acceleration.",
    topic: "Second Law of Motion",
    difficulty: "Medium",
  },
  {
    question: "Change in momentum of an object is equal to the_______",
    a: "Internal Energy",
    b: "Entropy",
    c: "Impulse",
    d: "Enthalpy",
    correct: "c",
    explanation: "The change in momentum of an object is equal to the impulse applied to it. Impulse is the product of force and the time duration over which the force is applied to the object.",
    topic: "Impulse",
    difficulty: "Medium",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a frame of reference?",
    a: "The speed of an object",
    b: "The position of an object",
    c: "The background against which motion is measured",
    d: "The force applied to an object",
    correct: "c",
    explanation: "A frame of reference is the background against which motion is measured. It provides a fixed point relative to which the position, motion, or rest of an object is described.",
    topic: "Frame Of Reference",
    difficulty: "Easy",
