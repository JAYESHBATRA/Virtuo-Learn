      question: "What is the common ratio of the geometric sequence 3, 6, 12, 24, ...?",
      a: "3",
      b: "2",
      c: "4",
      d: "6",
      correct: "b",
      explanation: "In a geometric sequence, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor called the common ratio. In this sequence, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2, so the common ratio is 2.",

      question: "The product of three consecutive terms in an arithmetic series is 2310. If the common difference is 5, find the terms.",
      a: "10, 15, 20",
      b: "7, 12, 17",
      c: "5, 10, 15",
      d: "8, 13, 18",
      correct: "b",
      explanation: "Let the terms be (x - 5), x, (x + 5). The product of these terms is (x - 5) * x * (x + 5) = 2310. Solving this equation gives x = 12. So, the terms are 7, 12, and 17.",

      question: "If the sum of an infinite geometric series is 12 and the common ratio is 1/3, find the first term.",
      a: "9",
      b: "6",
      c: "12",
      d: "3",
      correct: "a",
      explanation: "The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by S = a / (1 - r), where 'a' is the first term and 'r' is the common ratio. Given S = 12 and r = 1/3, we can solve for 'a' to find the first term.",

      a: "40",
      b: "45",
      c: "50",
      d: "55",
      correct: "a",
      explanation: "Using Vieta's formulas, we know that abc equals the constant term in the quadratic equation whose roots are a, b, and c. Given the sum and product of roots, we can form the equation x^3 - 15x^2 + 50x - abc = 0.",

      b: "800",
      c: "810",
      d: "830",
      correct: "c",
      explanation: "This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the sum: S = (n/2)(first term + last term) = (20/2)(4 + 80) = 10 * 84 = 840.",

      question: "If the sum of an arithmetic series is 75, the first term is 3, and the common difference is 5, how many terms are there?",
      a: "12",
      b: "15",
      c: "10",
      d: "18",
      correct: "a",
      explanation: "We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = (n/2)(first term + last term). Given S = 75, first term = 3, and common difference = 5, we can solve for 'n' to find the number of terms.",

      a: "2",
      b: "5",
      c: "3",
      d: "4",
      correct: "c",
      explanation: "The sum of an arithmetic series can be expressed as a quadratic function of 'n'. The coefficient of 'n^2' gives us half of the common difference, and the constant term gives us the first term.",

      c: "5",
      d: "6",
      correct: "b",

      explanation: "This is a geometric sequence with first term '2' and common ratio '2'. The product of the first 'n' terms of a geometric sequence is given by the first term raised to the power of 'n', multiplied by the ratio of the sum of the first 'n' terms and the first term.",
